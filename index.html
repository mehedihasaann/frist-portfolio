            <p class="p1">Curious, Hard worker, Self-learning, and Thinker, these four words can
                define me. I really like to research on the web and that makes me very
                eager to know some particular facts, normally about developing stuff. I
                like to learn new things and do a little project on it, which makes me a
                hard worker and passionate about developing. I think dreams always come
                with a hardworking and curious mind. With those four words in me, I
                guess I can really make a difference in my career life.
